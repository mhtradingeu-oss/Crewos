Create a secure and automated configuration management system where any changes to the config file are captured, reviewed by an authorized admin or through CI/CD pipeline with proper authentication before being merged into production. Use encrypted logging for sensitive data handling processes. Ensure there's manual approval workflow in place when exceptions need urgent attention from MH-OS senior team members only on critical updates and changes to the config file are flagged immediately using a separate, secure communication channel accessible by authorized personnel.
