# Getting Started

## Terminology
- **Control Plane:** The layer that manages, configures, and governs the system.
- **Data Plane:** The layer where business data flows and is processed.
- **Module:** A self-contained business domain (e.g., Product OS, Pricing Engine).

## Mental Model
MH-OS is a governance-first OS. Think of it as a secure, modular backbone for your business, where every action is logged, approvable, and risk-rated.

## System Overview
- Unified control and data planes
- Modular, upgradable domains
- Audit, approval, and risk at every step
