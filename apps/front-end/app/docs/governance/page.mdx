# Governance

## Decision Authority
- Every action is mapped to a decision authority
- Approvals are required for sensitive operations

## Approvals
- Multi-level approval workflows
- All approvals are logged and auditable

## Audit Logs
- Immutable audit trails for all actions
- Searchable and exportable

## Risk Levels
- Every action is risk-rated
- Risk levels determine required approvals
