# PHASE 2.4 — Replayability & State Machine Integrity

## ✅ Verified Replay & State Integrity
- <file-path> — evidence of replay snapshot + controlled state transitions

## ⚠️ Partial Replay / Unclear State Machine
- <file-path> — replay or transitions exist but are incomplete/unclear

## ❌ Missing Replay or Unsafe State Transitions
- <file-path> — no snapshot, or state transitions are mutable/uncontrolled

## 📌 State Inventory
- Run states: <list from code evidence>
- ActionRun states: <list from code evidence>

## 📌 Notes
- <file-path> — explanation
